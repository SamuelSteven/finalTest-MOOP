# Final Test Mobile Object-Oriented Programming

This is a final project from Mobile Object Oriented Programming Course. This project is a individual project. This project asked me to make an Android application for a mechanic in a workshop using Java Programming Languages and Android Studio as IDE. The application helps mechanics to perform maintenance on several types of vehicles, both two-wheeled or four-wheeled. Applications made must meet the following requirements:

- The application starts from the first activity, which is logging in. User data is stored in local storage. If the login fails, then display the alert dialog.
- The second activity contains a form to select the type of vehicle. The form contains two spinners. When the first spinner is selected, the second spinner appears. Then when the user clicks the "View" button, it will switch to the third activity.
- The third activity displays all vehicle data based on the two spinners that have been selected in the second activity.
